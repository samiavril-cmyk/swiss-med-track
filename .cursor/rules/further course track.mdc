# Courses and Continuing Education

## Overview
The Swiss Surgical Society (SGC) mandates and recognizes various courses and congresses essential for the continued education and certification maintenance of surgeons pursuing the "Facharzt Chirurgie." Completion of specific courses, including radiation safety training, is compulsory. Attending key congresses and accredited training sessions supports professional competency, legal compliance, and accreditation requirements.

## Mandatory Course Requirements

### 1. Radiation Safety (Certificate of Competence in Radiation Protection)
- Required by law for performing diagnostic and therapeutic X-ray examinations.
- The certificate documents in-depth knowledge of radiation protection in surgery.
- Comprises theoretical knowledge and practical training:
  - Radiation physics, dose management, patient and staff protection.
  - Practical exposure under mentorship in recognized training centers.
- Courses must be approved by Swiss federal authorities (BAG).
- Training completion is documented via a logbook sign-off by the training center head.

### 2. Core Course Attendance
- Attend a minimum of:
  - 3 annual congresses organized by the SGC.
  - 4 SGC-designated continuing medical education events annually.
  - 5 recognized courses of at least two days each (see list below).

### 3. Recognized Courses and Courses for Credit
- The following courses are recognized by the SGC and count toward mandatory continuing education credits:
  - Foundation in Gastrointestinal Surgery (GI Surgery) course in Davos.
  - Ultrasound courses by the Swiss Society for Ultrasound and Medicine (SGUM).
  - AO Foundation courses for orthopedic trauma and surgical fracture fixation.
- Courses accredited by the European Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (EACCME) are accepted (~1 credit per hour).

  - German Surgical Societies (DGG, DGOU)
  - Austrian Surgical and Trauma Societies (Ã–GC, OEGU)
  - European trauma and emergency societies (ESTES)
  - Other European and international surgical bodies.

### 4. Flexibility and Recognition of External Training
- Many relevant external congresses and courses are recognized as equivalent after board assessment ensuring content and program qualify towards education requirements.
- The list of recognized events is regularly updated.
- Participation must be documented for tracking continuing education points.

## Additional Notes
- Besides formal courses, surgeons are encouraged to engage in self-directed study, research, and publications.
- Continuing education points are tracked via the SIWF platform and reviewed every three years.
- Failure to comply with education requirements may impact the maintenance of the surgical specialist certification.

## Integration Suggestions
- The app should maintain a course catalogue linked with recognized providers and events.
- Trainee progress tracking must include courses completed, radiation safety certification, and congress attendance for comprehensive profile assessments.
- Notification and reminders for upcoming mandatory courses should be provided within the platform.
